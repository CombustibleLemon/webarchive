Vampire and I ran up the stairs looking for Dumbledore. We were so scared.

\begin{sloppypar}
    \enquote{Dumbledore Dumblydore!} we both yelled. Dumbledore came there.
\end{sloppypar}

\enquote{What is it that you want now you despicable snobs?} he asked angrily.

\enquote{Volsemort has Draco!} we shouted at the same time.

He laughed in an evil voice.

\enquote{No! Don't! We need to save Draco!} we begged.

\enquote{No.} he said meanly. \enquote{I don't give a darn what Voldemort does to Draco. Not after how much he misbehaved in school especially with YOU Ebony.} he said while he frowned looking at me. \enquote{Besides I never liked him that much anyway.} then he walked away. Vampire started crying. \enquote{My Draco!} he moaned. (\AN{don't u fik gay guyz r lik so hot!})

\enquote{Its okay!} I tried to tell him but that didn't stop him. He started to cry tears of blood. Then he had a brainstorm. \enquote{I had an idea!} he exclaimed.

\enquote{What?} I asked him.

\enquote{You'll see.} he said. He took out his wand and did a spell. Then\ldots{} suddenly we were in Voldemprt's lair!

We ran in with our wands out just as we heard a croon voice say. \enquote{Allah Kedavra!}
It was\dotfill Voldemort!
