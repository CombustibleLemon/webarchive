\AN[a/n: ]{TARA IS DA BIGGEST FUCKING BITCH EVER AND BY THE WAY I'M A BIGGER MCR FAN AND GERARD IS MINE 4EVA SO FUCK U! AND I'M NOT GIVING U UR SWEATER BACK!}

Eternity was so happy. She went to class with the other fifth-years, Sea, Draco, Shadow, Darren and Satan. That fucking retard Elvira (whose real name was Lindsay like that fucking ho Lindsay Loan) had gone all the way back to first-year and they put her in Gryffindor where all the retarded preps were because she couldn't even write properly and she had to get all her friends 2 do it for her.

Anyway, Eternity woke up from her dark slumber and got ready for the coming day, which she hated so much. She put on a black leather minidress with black fishnets and black pointy boots. Then she put on some mascara, white foundation, black lipstick, and eyeliner. Allt the gothic bois starred at her, their piercing blue eyes getting wide.

All the preps did to but for a different reason. She put up your middle finger at them. Then anyway she put on sum MCR music.

She plunged her black feet the stone cold ground and walked to Transfiguration. \enquote{Hello everyone.} said Professor McGonagall staring at them out of her giant eyes. \enquote{You will all be doing something different this time. You will all have partners.} She made everyone find a partner. Eternity's partner wasâ€¦ Draco!
