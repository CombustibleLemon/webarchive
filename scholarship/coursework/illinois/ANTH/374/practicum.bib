	year = {2014},
	volume		= {12},
	number		= {2},
	abstract = {This paper questions the binary of material and immaterial labour in the information era. Instead, we propose a “circuits of labour” model, a holistic framework that helps connect various concepts and traditions in the study of labour and ICT (information and communication technology). Inspired by du Gay et al’s “circuit of culture”, we argue conventional frameworks need to be synthesized and updated to reflect fundamental changes and persisting issues of labor in our contemporary era, of which the iPhone is emblematic. On the one hand, our model consists of formal circuits, in which hierarchical domination is imposed by capital over the body of labour. On the other hand, it consists of informal circuits where relationships are defined communally between embodied practices and social and communicative capital. The informal and formal circuits of labour are “short-circuited” by survival labour and ‘playbour’, meaning either circuit may absorb productive energy from the other. This article then uses the case of Foxconn, the world’s largest electronic manufacturer that also produces iPhones, to illustrate the usefulness of the “circuits of labour” model. We finally discuss the broader implications and questions for future research.},

We analyzed key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes and determine requirements for case isolation and contact-tracing needed to stop the epidemic. We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale. A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people. By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without need for mass quarantines ({\textquoteleft}lock-downs{\textquoteright}) that are harmful to society. We discuss the ethical requirements for an intervention of this kind.},

	abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an advanced automation and analytics system which exploits networking, sensing, big data, and artificial intelligence technology to deliver complete systems for a product or service. These systems allow greater transparency, control, and performance when applied to any industry or system. Due to their unique flexibility and ability to accommodate any environment, IoT systems attract a wide range of industrial, civilian, commercial, and military applications across the globe. They enhance data collection, automation, operations, and much more through smart devices and powerful enabling technology. However, there are many challenges facing the widespread usage of IoT, such as security, privacy, interoperability,standards, and emerging economies and development. In this paper, we concern with security and privacy of IoT, where we perform a vulnerability scanning of IoT devices in Jordan using the IoT search engine Shodan. The vulnerability scanning results is analyzed and presented to show how IoT devices could be an easily attacked and how they could be exposed by hackers The research outcomes should encourage IoT users in Jordan to be aware and watch out the security of their IoT devices to maintain high level of security and privacy.},

However, little is known explicitly about just who plays, with whom and how. This article presents the quantitative results of a survey of 753 parents of children aged 3–12 years about their child’s engagement with Minecraft. Our results establish Minecraft as the dominant digital game title played by this age group, particularly on tablet devices. We provide evidence of a marked early gendering of children’s Minecraft play and engagement with meta-game material. This research gives particular impetus to efforts aimed at ensuring gender equity in digital game–related cultural spaces inhabited by children. It also highlights the importance of collecting game-specific descriptive information, rather than limiting studies to aggregate measures of ‘screen time’. }

Semi-structured interviews with three participants, diagnosed with ASD between the ages of 16–21 years, yielded four themes that illustrated the social experiences of participants in this study. Emerging themes and participant comments identified in this study parallel those identified in the most recent research literature that has also sought to identify experiences and attributes that may lead to successful interpersonal relationships for individuals identified with ASD. Participants in this study articulated the desire to socialize, interact, and frequently communicate in a virtual environment; challenges with being misunderstood; issues with identification and perceptions of friends; and awareness of rules specific to face-to-face and virtual environments.},
